# Snakemake tutorial: How to run a very simple DNA-seq pipeline

1. Take a look at the slides in BIOF309_snakemake.pdf
2. Open up a Binder using the link below to get access to the Jupyter notebook and an environment with all necessary software installed
3. Once the Binder container has spun up, navigate to the directory "Genomics_practice" and open the Jupyter notebook.  There are two notebooks - one is already completed and run, the other is blank with hints for you to work through.
